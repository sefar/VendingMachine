1. You are to design a software driver for a vending machine
2. The vending machine operator will provide a list of inventory as well as the intial change present in the machine
3. A list of user inputs (change deposited, buttons pressed) will be provided
4. A final inventory must be the output of this program this will include the final counts of all product, the 
   remaining change and the total dollar value present in the change box.

2nd point.
11. All deposits go to the change box, refunds are given from the intial change provided as a part of the inventory list.
   If we are unable to give exact change (out of a particular small denomination coin)
   the next smallest denomination will be returned in its place.
